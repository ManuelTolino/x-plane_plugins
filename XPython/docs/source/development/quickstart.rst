Quick Start
===========

So you want to create a plugin?

First, make sure you can actually run an XPPython3 plugin -- if X-Plane, Python, and XPPython3 aren't set up
correctly, you'll get no where.

* Your version of X-Plane is *at least* 11.50 (beta versions are okay)

* You've installed XPPython3 as described in :doc:`/usage/installation_plugin`.

* You've successfully executed an XPPython3 plugin within X-Plane. If you need an example, download
  :download:`PI_HelloWorld1.py <https://github.com/pbuckner/x-plane_plugins/raw/master/XPython/demos/PI_HelloWorld1.py>`
  and place it in your Resources/plugins/PythonPlugins folder.

Once you have a running system, we'll cover some basic code:

* **Skeleton**: the required minimum code to do absolutely nothing

* **Hello World**: a simple plugin with a popup window.
  
* **Hello Widget**: a simple plugin with a popup window using widgets.
