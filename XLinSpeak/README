This version is now fully self supporting - no need for any extraction
scripts, everything is extracted at the runtime from the executable.

Building requires libspeechd-dev package and also nasm.

By default both 32 and 64 bit plugins are built; it seems that the 
libspeechd development package has a problem as installing the 32bit
version of the package removes the 64bit one. To be able to build everything
at once, I installed the 32bit dev. package, copied the 32bit libspeechd .so 
files from /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu (libspeechd.so, libspeechd.so.2, 
libspeechd.so.2.6.0)...

The plugin works in the current XP11 and also XP10 32 and 64 bits; XP9 will 
follow soon.
